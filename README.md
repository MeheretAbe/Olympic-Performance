## Olympic-Performance
The goal is to uncover trends and insights of 120 years of Olympic data to help the Olympic Committee of the USA improve resource allocation and elevate the USAs presence and performance on the world stage of sports.
## Goals of the Project: 
•  Exploring Competitors: Identify the USA’s closest overall competitors and in each discipline
(sports) throughout the years. You may limit your analysis to the top three or five competitors
wherever needed in the remaining tasks.
• Geographic Analysis: Examine the geographical distribution of medals, identifying trends in the
dominance of specific continents or regions. What are the key competencies of each continent?
• Core Competencies: Analyze the core competency of the USA's closest competitors. You may
consider different factors such as athlete physical characteristics (height, and weight), age, and
gender. Analyze competitors' performances and trends to develop strategic insights and competitive
advantages that can be leveraged during Olympic competitions. Additionally, report any surprising
data points (outliers). What insights do the outliers present?
• Analyzing Athletes' Physical Characteristics: Investigate the correlation between athletes'
physical attributes, such as height and weight, and their medal-winning potential to gain insights
into the physiological factors that contribute to sports performance.
• Sex-wise Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of Olympic medals by gender can provide valuable
insights into the participation and performance trends of male and female athletes over time.
Explore how the sex-wise distribution of medals impacts the total number of medals awarded and
the broader context of gender equality in sports.
• Optimize Resource Allocation: Allocate resources strategically based on data-driven insights to
maximize the impact on medal-winning potential. In what disciplines (sports), would you
recommend USA to make more investment in sending more athletes? You may assume that sending
athletes to the Olympics costs the same regardless of their discipline. How sensitive your
recommendations are concerning this assumption?

## Data Analytics Workflow:
1. Dataset Exploration:
• Begin by identifying and accessing relevant datasets from reputable sources such as sports
organizations, government databases, or academic repositories.
• Utilize platforms like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), Data.gov (https://data.gov/),
or academic databases to search for datasets pertinent to the targeted questions.
2. Data Examination and Exploration:
• Conduct a thorough exploration and inspection of the dataset to understand its structure,
variables, and potential limitations.
• Employ descriptive statistics, data visualization techniques, and preliminary analyses to uncover
any notable patterns, trends, or anomalies.
• Engage in data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to address missing values, outliers, or
inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset's quality and integrity.
3. Define Analytical Objectives:
• Clearly articulate the specific questions or hypotheses to be addressed through the data analytics
process.
• Identify key metrics, variables, or factors of interest that will be examined to answer the targeted
questions effectively.
4. Analytical Techniques:
• Select appropriate analytical methods and techniques based on the nature of the questions and
the characteristics of the dataset.
5. Unveiling Discoveries:
• Conduct in-depth analysis and exploration of the data to unveil any unexpected or insightful
discoveries that may emerge during the analytical process.



• Utilize exploratory data analysis techniques, and advanced modeling approaches to uncover
novel insights or patterns within the data.
6. Interpretation and Communication:
• Interpret the findings and insights derived from the data analysis in the context of the original
research questions or objectives.
• Communicate the results effectively through clear and concise visualizations, reports, or
presentations, ensuring stakeholders can understand and utilize the insights for informed
decision-making.
