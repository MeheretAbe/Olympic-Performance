# Olympic-Performance

**Topic:** Olympic Performance Analysis and Prediction


**Project:** To uncover trends and insights of 120 years of Olympic data to help the Olympic Committee of the USA improve resource allocation and elevate the USAs presence and performance on the world stage of sports.


**Goal of the Project:** 
   • Exploring Competitors: Identify the USA’s closest overall competitors and in each discipline
(sports) throughout the years
   • Geographic Analysis: Examine the geographical distribution of medals, identifying trends in the dominance of specific continents or regions.
   • Core Competencies: Analyze the core competency of the USA's closest competitors. You may
consider different factors such as athlete physical characteristics (height, and weight), age, and gender.
   • Analyzing Athletes' Physical Characteristics: Investigate the correlation between athletes'
physical attributes, such as height and weight, and their medal-winning potential to gain insights into the physiological factors that contribute to sports performance.
   • Sex-wise Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of Olympic medals by gender can provide valuable insights into the participation and performance trends of male and female athletes over time.
   • Optimize Resource Allocation: Allocate resources strategically based on data-driven insights to maximize the impact on medal-winning potential. In what disciplines (sports), would you recommend USA to make more investment in sending more athletes? 

**Data Analytics Workflow:** 

**1. Dataset Exploration**: 
   • The dataset is obtained [here from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mateoiglesias/olympic-games/input).

**2. Data Examination and Exploration**:
   • Thorough exploration and inspection of the dataset to understand its structure,variables, and potential limitations.
   • Employ descriptive statistics, data visualization techniques, and preliminary analyses to uncover any notable patterns, trends, or 
     anomalies.
   • Engage in data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to address missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset's quality and integrity.
     
**3. Define Analytical Objectives**:
   • Clearly articulate the specific questions or hypotheses to be addressed through the data analytics process.
   • Identify key metrics, variables, or factors of interest that will be examined to answer the targeted questions effectively.

**4. Analytical Techniques**:
   • Select appropriate analytical methods and techniques based on the nature of the questions and the characteristics of the dataset.

**5. Unveiling Discoveries**:
   • Conduct in-depth analysis and exploration of the data to unveil any unexpected or insightful
discoveries that may emerge during the analytical process.
   • Utilize exploratory data analysis techniques, and advanced modeling approaches to uncover novel insights or patterns within the data.
